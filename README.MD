#SkeletorJS
A barebones Node app that uses Express and socket.io to get your realtime app off the ground and running quickly

Getting up and running:
```git clone git@github.com:aahill50/skeletorJS.git yourProjectName```
```cd yourProjectName```
```npm install```
```npm start``` to get your local server running on port 3334
Go to ```localhost:3334``` to make sure the page loads

Now that you've got it working, use ```ctrl```+```c``` to kill the server and start creating!
